Project by Klaudia Rychter, created as a part of engineering thesis - "Change facial expressions based on emotions using GAN networks".
Purpose of this application is to test trained CycleGAN models on any given picture depicting human face.
It is recommended that tested image is in a square format, otherwise it's resizing may cause significant deformation.

To change facial expression of a person, it is necessary to pick a photo by clicking "Load picture".
"Load picture" button opens a file explorer. First opened folder 'samples' includes a few pictures from fer2013 dataset, labeled as PublicTest images.
After choosing a picture it is displayed in an application's window.
By clicking any of the buttons named after emotions, there is a new picture being generated, with facial expression changed accordingly.
Generating a new picture may take a moment. After it's created it's displayed on the right side of the original picture.

Included in /models/neutral_[emotion_name] folders CycleGAN models were trained with CycleGAN Keras implementation by Simon Karlsson,
on fer2013 dataset.
CycleGAN Keras implementation page: https://github.com/simontomaskarlsson/CycleGAN-Keras
fer2013 dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data

To use this application on different models or with different model weights switch existing files model.json and weights.hdf5
in /models/neutral_[emotion_name]. Names of the files should remain the same.
Folders may include files with different weights under name weights_tmp*.hdf5. It is possible to test them by renaming them to weights.hdf5
(make sure to rename previous weights.hdf5 file before)

Last transformed file and it's modified version is saved in /tmp folder as greyscale.jpg (for input file, resized and turned into grayscale)
and modified.png (for modified file).
